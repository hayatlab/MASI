VEGFA was expressed at higher levels in the neuroendocrine tumor cells and the immune cells of the primary tumor compared to the metastatic tumor (Fig. 2C). VEGFA is known to be expressed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and the differential expression may indicate a lower influx of TAMs at the metastatic site (Ugel et al. 2015). VEGFB was expressed at high levels in the fibroblasts of the primary tumor but not in its metastatic counterparts and TGFB1, whereas VEGFC was expressed at comparable levels in Endothelial cellss (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the metastatic Endothelial cellss expressed higher levels of the VEGF receptor gene FLT1 and significantly higher levels of KDR, the latter being the primary VEGF receptor for mitogenic signaling (Fig. 2D). Additionally, the metastatic Endothelial cellss produced PDGFB, which the primary tumor Endothelial cellss did not, establishing a possible paracrine signaling support for the metastatic PDGFRB-expressing pericytes (Fig. 2D)."

More importantly, fetal ETP2 exhibited downregulation of stem- and progenitor-cell-related genes, such as CD34 and MEIS1 (Figures 2Dand 2E). The genes coding key TFs mediating T lymphocytespecialization, including TCF7 and BCL11B driven by NOTCHsignaling pathway (Weber et al., 2011; Li et al., 2010), werealso enriched in fetal ETP2 cluster (Figure 2E)."

t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) (Amir el et al., 2013) and labeled according to marker gene expression (Figure S1D). Enteric glial cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils were not detected, probably due to technical limitations.

t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) (Amir el et al., 2013) and labeled according to marker gene expression (Figure S1D). Enteric glial cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils were not detected, probably due to technical limitations.

Individual cells from the two iSN populationswere analyzed and algorithmically clustered based on transcriptional similarity (Figure 5A;see STAR Methods). NC-iSN1s and NC-iSN2s formed separate groups with little crossover, except for some NC-iSN2s that clustered among NC-iSN1s. Both conditions showedremarkable homogeneity within themselves, and no meaningful sub-clusters were identifiedbased on differential expression of sensory genes. Inspecting single genes revealedagreement between the bulk and single-nuclei RNA sequencing. Both cell clusters expressedSCN9A and PIEZO2, only NC-iSN1s expressed TRPM8, and TRPV1 was essentially absent(Figure 5B). Thus, the two neural crest-derived populations are each comprised of a distinctand homogeneous iSN subtype"	Transcriptional Programming of Human Mechanosensory Neuron Subtypes from Pluripotent Stem Cells	Alec R Nickolls	2020.1	GSE139409
